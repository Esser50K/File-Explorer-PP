# FileExplorer++ v1.0
```
usage: File Explorer ++ [-h] [-v] -i INPUT [-o OUTPUT] {shrink} ...

        If you're reading this, YOU'VE BEEN HAX!

        File Explorer ++ can currently shrink a single file of your choosing to any size smaller than that, but can also batch this operation! Have a directory that has a mix of text files, zip files, exe, etc? No worries, this supports batch processesing for all JPEGs & PNGs (will test for other formats later)

        The roadmap consists of:
                - Full resizing features
                - Image Sorter by Color Space
                - Toggle if you want to save all changes into its own directory

        Enjoy until the next update! ^^
